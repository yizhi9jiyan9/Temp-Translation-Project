## How to create a new item #
1. Copy folder of similar item and rename.
2. Create /give for new item (and any variations) and put it into update
3. Enter any code that runs as you hold it into dur. If there is a tmr put it under itemMtmr
4: Than do global stuff. goto bottom list for this
5: Edit update to include variables in dur that determine the state of item
6: Than add reset code for all data (besides tmr & clear) used in dur and visible effets (potions, titles, ect.) into reset
7: Finally put correct functions in []/glob, []/main, []/reset, []/set, []/update
8. Than add any items in inventory to all.json


## How to do global stuff ##
1. Create glob file and put all things that need to be run outside of player.
2. Add to []/glob with some kind of condition (ex: the entity necessary existing)
3. Ensure that if it can damage other players (or knock them around) that you set the entity OuchID to the player's HitID (should be done in dur)
4. Than have a way to set the OuchID to possible target's Pos[blank]ID, blank being damage type, if it is incosistant
 - Make sure to have the [blank] damage type be detectable by advancements and cleared at the bottom of death section in game main
5. If it is something consistant (damage being done in the command) you can set to HitterID and set HitTmr
